## Projects

### 1. Insurance Fraud Analysis
[Car Insurance fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/incarnyx/car-insurance-fraud) is an open source dataset containing data from an unknown insurance company between the yeasr 1994 and 1996.
In this project I explore, clean and cluster the data and try to make insights about which groups of people are more likely to make fraudulant claims. At the last section I use different Machine Learning algorithms to predict fraudulant claims.
